					<p>On January 15, 1919 one of the strangest</p>
					<p>and most absurd events occurred.</p>
					<p>What would later become known as</p>
					<p>The Great Molasses Flood took place in</p>
					<p>the North End neighborhood of</p>
					<p>Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
					<p>As absurd as it may sound,</p>
					<p>this was in fact a real world, historical event</p>
					<p>and the story goes something like this.</p>
					<p>January of 1919 was just like any other winter.</p>
					<p>On January 12, it was cold with a temperature</p>
					<p>of around 2 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
					<p>However, on the 13th the temperature began to rise.</p>
					<p>On the 15th the temperature had risen to</p>
					<p>about 41 degrees Fahrenheit, which was not too</p>
					<p>out of the ordinary and was certainly a nice</p>
					<p>improvement over the frigid temperatures</p>
					<p>of the previous days.</p>
					<p>The 15th started out just like any other day would.</p>
					<p>To most everyone at the time, it was just another</p>
					<p>Wednesday. But, of course, all tragedies and life</p>
					<p>changing events happen on seemingly ordinary days.</p>
					<p>At around 12:41 PM the residents of</p>
					<p>North End, Boston heard a loud rumble similar</p>
					<p>to that of a passing train. There was an elevated</p>
					<p>railway that ran through that area, so this was</p>
					<p>nothing out of the ordinary. That was, of course,</p>
					<p>until it was out of the ordinary.</p>
					<p>The sound quickly became much louder than that</p>
					<p>of a passing train and just a split second after</p>
					<p>the sound was heard, a 40 foot wave of some dark,</p>
					<p>viscous liquid, flew through the neighbourhood at</p>
					<p>over 30 miles an hour. And of course with the</p>
					<p>high viscosity the wave was also very sticky.</p>
					<p>This, however, did not slow the wave down,</p>
					<p>it continued to fly through the neighbourhood</p>
					<p>at incredible speeds. There was no time to</p>
					<p>escape the wave, or even comprehend what</p>
					<p>was happening. Anyone in the path of the wave,</p>
					<p>was swept away, along with all the houses, cars,</p>
					<p>animals, and pretty much everything else.</p>
					<p>Many people were smashed into nearby walls</p>
					<p>and many were swept into the nearby harbor.</p>
					<p>This wave was not at all water, but instead a dark,</p>
					<p>sticky, viscous liquid, known as molasses.</p>
					<p>It might not sound like this wave would be that</p>
					<p>much worse than water (other than the cleanup, of course)</p>
					<p>but a wave of molasses is actually far</p>
					<p>worse than a wave of water. You see, molasses</p>
					<p>is around 60% more dense than the design of water,</p>
					<p>so a wave of molasses does far more damage</p>
					<p>than a wave of water. Not to mention the fact that</p>
					<p>the molasses made rescue operations nearly impossible.</p>
					<p>The Boston Post reported:</p>
					<p>"Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and</p>
					<p>swirled and bubbled about the wreckage...</p>
					<p>Here and there struggled a form—whether it was animal</p>
					<p>or human being was impossible to tell.</p>
					<p>Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass,</p>
					<p>showed where any life was...</p>
					<p>Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper.</p>
					<p>The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess</p>
					<p>they were ensnared. Human beings</p>
					<p>—men and women—suffered likewise."</p>
					<p>And of course, it was not only persons</p>
					<p>caught in the initial wave who where struggling,</p>
					<p>but also the rescuers. The first rescuers to the scene</p>
					<p>were 116 cadets under the direction of</p>
					<p>Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from the</p>
					<p>nearby Massachusetts Nautical School.</p>
					<p>Shortly after, personnel from the Boston Police,</p>
					<p>Army, Navy, and Red Cross arrived on the scene.</p>
					<p>The conditions were not at all optimal</p>
					<p>and to make them yet worse, the molasses</p>
					<p>began to cool, and thickened even more than</p>
					<p>it was before. The increasing viscosity made it</p>
					<p>harder and yet harder for those trying to escape the mess,</p>
					<p>and for the rescuers trying to traverse through it.</p>
					<p>Many of the rescuers worked through the night to find</p>
					<p>and tend to the dozens of injured people and</p>
					<p>their fellow exhausted rescuers. It was so hard to find</p>
					<p>people in the mess that it took 4 days before</p>
					<p>rescue operations ended. Although, many of the dead</p>
					<p>had been swept out into the harbor where they were</p>
					<p>not found until months after the event.</p>
					<p>In total, around 150 people were injured, and 21 died.</p>
					<p>At this point you're probably wondering where so</p>
					<p>much molasses could come from.</p>
					<p>Well, it all came from a large storage tank near the harbor.</p>
					<p>Molasses was unloaded from ships, put in the storage tank,</p>
					<p>and later transferred via pipeline to</p>
					<p>the Purity ethanol plant in Cambridge.</p>
					<p>During January 12 and 13, just a couple days</p>
					<p>before the disaster, a ship had unloaded it's</p>
					<p>supply of molasses into the tank. Since the temperatures</p>
					<p>were rather cold, the molasses was heated to lower</p>
					<p>it's viscosity for the transfer. On the 13th, just shortly</p>
					<p>after the transfer was complete, many workers heard</p>
					<p>the sound of bubbling inside the tank. It was later reported:</p>
					<p>"The warm molasses… was mixing with the cold,</p>
					<p>thick molasses that had been congealing inside</p>
					<p>the tank for weeks, producing a bubbling churn</p>
					<p>that vibrated against the tank's walls.</p>
					<p>The men on the Commercial Street wharf heard those</p>
					<p>walls groaning, [like they] had heard them groan many</p>
					<p>times before, usually immediately after a delivery, but it</p>
					<p>is unlikely that they knew that when warm and cold</p>
					<p>molasses mix, the reaction triggers a fermentation</p>
					<p>process that produces gas. And in a near-full tank,</p>
					<p>that gas increases the pressure against the steel walls."</p>
					<p>Not only was the molasses fermenting and</p>
					<p>increasing pressure, but with the new delivery of molasses,</p>
					<p>the tank was nearly at it's maximum capacity</p>
					<p>"with 2.3 million gallons of molasses that reached a</p>
					<p>height of forty-eight feet, nine inches,</p>
					<p>and weighed 26 million pounds."</p>
					<p>This is very likely the reason why the tank burst.</p>
					<p>Although, it was also found that the tank had not been</p>
					<p>built properly and even before the disaster,</p>
					<p>it leaked molasses. In fact, it leaked so bad that</p>
					<p>the tank was painted brown to hide the leakage.</p>
					<p>After the disaster, the Purity Distilling Company eventually</p>
					<p>was forced to pay for damages estimated at around $628,000</p>
					<p>(which would be equivalent to nearly $11 million today).</p>
					<p>Not surprisingly, the mess was a nightmare to clean up.</p>
					<p>Cleanup crews, which of consisted of hundreds people,</p>
					<p>used various methods including spraying seawater from a</p>
					<p>fireboat to wash away the molasses and</p>
					<p>also using sand to absorb it. But even with so many people,</p>
					<p>it took months to clean the area. Rescuers, cleanup crews,</p>
					<p>and sight-seers had tracked the molasses everywhere.</p>
					<p>It was even reported that:</p>
					<p>"Everything a Bostonian touched was sticky."</p>
					<p>Even decades after the disaster, residents reported that</p>
					<p>the area still smelled like molasses on hot summer days.</p>
					<p>This disaster is certainly one of the most</p>
					<p>absurd tragedies, that has ever occurred!</p>
