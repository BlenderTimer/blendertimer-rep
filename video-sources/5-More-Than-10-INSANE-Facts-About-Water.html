					<p>Water is the most abundant molecule on Earth.</p>
					<p>So abundant, in fact, that if Earth lost 10 trillion drops of water every second,</p>
					<p>it would take over 80 thousand years for Earth to lose all of its water!</p>
					<p>Of course this isn't too surprising since Earth's water weighs over 1.5 quintillion tons.</p>
					<p>Which believe it or not is only about 0.0002% of all Earth's mass!</p>
					<p>Although every cloud in the sky weighs around 1 million tons.</p>
					<p>So they're not actually light and fluffy at all,</p>
					<p>they are uh...</p>
					<p>heavy and fluffy...</p>
					<p>which doesn't make any sense...</p>
					<p>Anyway, water is the only substance on Earth that can be naturally found in three forms.</p>
					<p>The three forms being liquid, solid, and gas.</p>
					<p>When it's in it's liquid form it's typically referred to as water...</p>
					<p>you didn't know that...</p>
					<p>right?</p>
					<p>In it's solid form it's typically referred to as ice...</p>
					<p>that was news to absolutely no one.</p>
					<p>And in it's gaseous form it's typically referred to as water vapor or</p>
					<p>[*clears throat]</p>
					<p>steam.</p>
					<p>Of course it's gas form has nothing to do with gasoline.</p>
					<p>Don't get those two confused or you'll end up with a worse situation</p>
					<p>then that time you tried to use a laser pointer as a jack.</p>
					<p>Oh and remember how there's like some 1.5 quintillion tons of water on Earth?</p>
					<p>Well, most of that water is actually salt water.</p>
					<p>97.5% to be not exact, but as close to exact as science can figure.</p>
					<p>If you want some fresh water you've got to head over to Antarctica.</p>
					<p>Where some 70% of our fresh water is.</p>
					<p>Now, don't get confused, there's not like a giant fresh water lake in Antarctica.</p>
					<p>Oh no, it's far to cold for that,</p>
					<p>all that fresh water is located in the 7.2 million cubic miles of ice there.</p>
					<p>Most of Earth's fresh water is frozen.</p>
					<p>30% of the Earth's fresh water is located in the ground,</p>
					<p>in the form of...</p>
					<p>you guessed it...</p>
					<p>groundwater.</p>
					<p>Oh, and we can't forget the billions of lakes and rivers that make up a whole uh...</p>
					<p>0.1% of the Earth's water.</p>
					<p>And rather shockingly, this nearly invisible and tasteless liquid,</p>
					<p>can dissolve more substances than any other liquid on the planet.</p>
					<p>It can even dissolve metals!</p>
					<p>Hence why it's often referred to as the Universal Solvent.</p>
					<p>Of course, it can't dissolve everything.</p>
					<p>I mean if you put some oil in water you'll find that out pretty quickly.</p>
					<p>Now while it can dissolve metal, it's important to note that most metals</p>
					<p>will only dissolve slightly in water.</p>
					<p>This is because after some time there is a coating formed around the metal known as rust.</p>
					<p>And, of course, rust largely protects the inner metal from the water.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>When referring to water here we're referring to pure water.</p>
					<p>Pure water, is simply H2O.</p>
					<p>Which, by the way, does not mean that it converts hamsters to ostriches.</p>
					<p>It simply means that there are 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom in 1 water molecule.</p>
					<p>There are about 1.5 sextillion water molecules in one drop of water.</p>
					<p>Which means there's about 7 septillion molecules in 1 glass of water,</p>
					<p>about 3 undecillion molecules in a lake,</p>
					<p>and about 5 octodecillion molecules on Earth.</p>
					<p>Don't worry about remembering those numbers though,</p>
					<p>just remember that pure water has a pH of around 7.</p>
					<p>For comparison lemon juice as a pH of around 2 and soap has a pH of around 10.</p>
					<p>The pH of course representing "potential hydrogen"</p>
					<p>which probably didn't help any.</p>
					<p>Just know that pH represents the acidity of the substance.</p>
					<p>The lower the pH the higher the acidity and the higher the pH the lower the acidity.</p>
					<p>0 being the lowest pH and 14 being the highest pH.</p>
					<p>When frozen, water expands by about 9%.</p>
					<p>Actually, that's a very pathetically simple way of putting it</p>
					<p>but we'll get to that a bit later.</p>
					<p>When water expands it can create enormous pressure.</p>
					<p>So much pressure, in fact, that if you filled an iron sphere with water</p>
					<p>and then froze it,</p>
					<p>the water would expand and the iron sphere would explode!</p>
					<p>That is quite some energy!</p>
					<p>Anyway, back to the pathetically simple 9% expansion statement.</p>
					<p>Most liquids, such as paraffin wax and oil, get more dense when cooled.</p>
					<p>And water, as a liquid, also get's more dense as it cools.</p>
					<p>You're probably now confused as to why it expands but it also shrinks.</p>
					<p>This is because water shrinks in volume until about 40°F.</p>
					<p>Then the water suddenly stops condensing (or shrinking) and begins expanding.</p>
					<p>As it expands it of course get's less dense.</p>
					<p>This is the reason why ice floats on the surface.</p>
					<p>And because it floats on the surface,</p>
					<p>it keeps much of the water underneath from further freezing.</p>
					<p>Water is the only liquid on the entire planet that expands when frozen.</p>
					<p>And if it weren't for this amazing singularity in it's design,</p>
					<p>ice would simply sink and more ice would form on the surface.</p>
					<p>This would continue until all the streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, and even the ocean</p>
					<p>were completely frozen and the Earth would become a massive ball of ice.</p>
