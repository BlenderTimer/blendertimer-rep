					<p>What would an ideal language sound like?</p>
					<p>Or, what would it look like?</p>
					<p>If you were biased,</p>
					<p>you might think that English is the most superior,</p>
					<p>or that Spanish is the most superior,</p>
					<p>or that some other language is the most superior.</p>
					<p>But if you think about it for even just a few seconds,</p>
					<p>you'll realize how pathetic all of these languages are.</p>
					<p>I mean English, the worst of them all,</p>
					<p>has words such as "analysis".</p>
					<p>Which, by the way, is 100% Latin.</p>
					<p>It's not even English.</p>
					<p>Same with "pure" which is 100% French,</p>
					<p>"trade" which is 100% German,</p>
					<p>"simple" which is also 100% French,</p>
					<p>"area" which is 100% Latin,</p>
					<p>"index" which is 100% Latin,</p>
					<p>and basically half the other "English" words.</p>
					<p>And I mean, this is a horn.</p>
					<p>This is also a horn.</p>
					<p>And this is red.</p>
					<p>This is also read.</p>
					<p>Or you could read it.</p>
					<p>Both are spelled exactly the same</p>
					<p>but sound different, depending on the mood your in.</p>
					<p>I guess...</p>
					<p>And of course, this is dessert.</p>
					<p>And this is deserted.</p>
					<p>And this is the desert.</p>
					<p>And of course you deserve this</p>
					<p>because it's your desert.</p>
					<p>So just don't desert the deserted desert of your desert</p>
					<p>or you'll desert the dessert you had that was your</p>
					<p>desert in the deserted desert.</p>
					<p>[CUT]</p>
					<p>Anyway, the point is,</p>
					<p>English is completely out of the question</p>
					<p>because it's basically just all the other</p>
					<p>languages combined into one rubbish pile.</p>
					<p>But maybe there's another language that's better.</p>
					<p>I mean it's quite possible that somewhere there's a</p>
					<p>language that's far superior to anything we've ever seen.</p>
					<p>Although...</p>
					<p>I don't think we're going to find it amongst humans.</p>
					<p>You see, humans have changed their languages</p>
					<p>millions of times throughout history.</p>
					<p>Which can only mean two things.</p>
					<p>One, we still don't have a perfect language.</p>
					<p>Or two, we're just really stupid.</p>
					<p>You would think that, as the same species,</p>
					<p>humans would all speak the same language.</p>
					<p>But currently, there's over 7000 languages</p>
					<p>spoken amongst humans.</p>
					<p>Oh, and, believe it or not,</p>
					<p>as incompetent as English is,</p>
					<p>it's still the language with the most speakers.</p>
					<p>Now before you go clacking away about how</p>
					<p>Chinese has the most speakers,</p>
					<p>note that English has the most speakers overall,</p>
					<p>but Chinese (specifically Mandarin) has the</p>
					<p>most "native" speakers.</p>
					<p>In fact English has nearly twice as many non-native</p>
					<p>speakers as as it does native speakers.</p>
					<p>While Mandarin has over 4.6 times more native</p>
					<p>speakers than non-native speakers. </p>
					<p>Actually,</p>
					<p>I guess binary has the most speakers.</p>
					<p>I mean, there's over 30 billion electronic devices on Earth,</p>
					<p>all of which speak binary so...</p>
					<p>Anyway, in total English has over 1.1 billion speakers.</p>
					<p>That are all "Made in China".</p>
					<p>Oh wait, wrong speakers.</p>
					<p>I told you English was confusing.</p>
					<p>Especially since there's like tons of words that</p>
					<p>have other words that look and/or sound almost</p>
					<p>identical to each other.</p>
					<p>Kinda like though, through, thorough, tough, trough, thought.</p>
					<p>Like was English just made to be confusing?</p>
					<p>Ok.</p>
					<p>We could try to create a superior language in a</p>
					<p>simple yet fully capable way,</p>
					<p>a great example being Morse Code.</p>
					<p>Morse Code is superior in some ways to English,</p>
					<p>mainly in the fact that because it's so simple,</p>
					<p>you can speak it with lights,</p>
					<p>horns (not that kind), electric pulses, dots and dashes,</p>
					<p>and pretty much anything else.</p>
					<p>But where it lacks is in the fact that it takes ages just</p>
					<p>to communicate one word.</p>
					<p>I mean, just communicating one letter can take</p>
					<p>anywhere from 30 milliseconds to 2 seconds!</p>
					<p>[code audio]</p>
					<p>And if you want to communicate</p>
					<p>even a very short word like "help!",</p>
					<p>it's going to take you anywhere from 6 to 8 seconds!</p>
					<p>[code audio]</p>
					<p>If you want to communicate a sentence such as</p>
					<p>"The current condition is hazardous."</p>
					<p>it could take up to a minute!</p>
					<p>I guess if you were really great at thinking at the</p>
					<p>speed of light you could transmit the information</p>
					<p>in lightning fast way.</p>
					<p>[code audio]</p>
					<p>Most computers would be able to interpret that</p>
					<p>but for a human...</p>
					<p>that's going to be impossible.</p>
					<p>Although, despite all the issues with Morse Code,</p>
					<p>it does sound kinda interesting, you got to admit.</p>
					<p>Maybe instead of looking at languages invented</p>
					<p>by humans though,</p>
					<p>we should search for the perfect language in</p>
					<p>the animal kingdom.</p>
					<p>I mean you can already find many similar languages</p>
					<p>to Morse Code amongst many marine animals</p>
					<p>and insects such as crickets.</p>
					<p>In fact I discovered by accident that crickets</p>
					<p>have some sort of code they use for communication</p>
					<p>that's nearly identical to Morse Code.</p>
					<p>Take a listen to this sound captured just few</p>
					<p>inches from the cricket.</p>
					<p>[cricket audio]</p>
					<p>If you listen to this much slower and analyze the</p>
					<p>audio's spectrogram, you'll see that each</p>
					<p>singular trill of the cricket is multiple smaller pulses.</p>
					<p>[audio slower]</p>
					<p>Each pulse appears to be the same pitch</p>
					<p>but there's distinctly a code there.</p>
					<p>And just like Morse Code,</p>
					<p>it's composed of long and short pulses.</p>
					<p>I don't know what the code is or how to translate it,</p>
					<p>but I do find it quite fascinating!</p>
					<p>In fact, I wrote down the code of the full 2 minute clip.</p>
					<p>Not that it was of any use.</p>
					<p>I'll leave links in the description for the spreadsheet</p>
					<p>and the full 2 minute audio clip,</p>
					<p>just in case anyone is interested in analyzing</p>
					<p>it more thoroughly.</p>
					<p>The issue with all these Morse Code type</p>
					<p>languages though, is that they're not very elegant.</p>
					<p>They sound interesting, sure, but they don't have</p>
					<p>the nice flow some other languages have.</p>
					<p>Birds, for example, have some of the most elegant</p>
					<p>language on the planet.</p>
					<p>[goose]</p>
					<p>Well...</p>
					<p>songbirds at least.</p>
					<p>I mean, the Pacific Wren was designed with the most</p>
					<p>stunning song I've ever heard.</p>
					<p>[song audio]</p>
					<p>Sounds great, right?</p>
					<p>In those 9 seconds, it's possible the bird could have</p>
					<p>said the equivalent of over 50 English words.</p>
					<p>In fact, as it turns out, if you play this song at one quarter</p>
					<p>it's original speed, you won't hear a bird song at all,</p>
					<p>but instead a full orchestra.</p>
					<p>[song at 0.25x speed]</p>
					<p>Doesn't it just sound like an entire paragraph?</p>
					<p>Perhaps it's just me, but</p>
					<p>I find these different languages fascinating!</p>
					<p>The fact that all these languages sound completely</p>
					<p>different but are all still very interesting in their own way.</p>
					<p>And sometimes you almost feel like</p>
					<p>you can understand them.</p>
					<p>Which of these languages was your favorite?</p>
					<p>Please don't tell me it was English.</p>
