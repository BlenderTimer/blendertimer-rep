Around 51% of people are terrified of sharks but,
while sharks where designed with a slightly
aggressive appearance, being terrified of them
is for no real reason.
Sharks only attack around 62 people per year,
and only about 8 to 16 percent of those attacks
are actually fatal.
That means sharks only kill
5 to 10 humans per year.
Compared to the 433,000 deaths
per year caused by sitting.
Oh, and you know how many sharks humans
kill per year? 100 million.
That’s over 3 sharks per second!
Although, the lead researcher in the study
actually said that the 100 million was a
conservative estimate.
The actual number could actually be over
270 million!
That’s over 8 sharks per second!
