Did you know that it rains diamonds?
Well, not on Earth,
but on the four gas planets.
This is because there is a lot of methane
in their atmospheres.
Lightning storms turn methane
into carbon which hardens as it falls,
turning into graphite
and eventually diamonds!
It's estimated that around 1000 tons
worth of diamonds rain down
in just one year!
