The loudest animal on Earth is the sperm whale.
It’s the fourth largest animal on Earth
and they produce a variety of clicks used for
echolocation and communication.
These clicks can exceed 230 decibels.
For comparison an airplane is generally
150 decibels at takeoff,
a rocket is around 200 decibels,
and an atomic bomb is anywhere from
220 to 280 decibels!
These clicks produced by the sperm whale
are so loud that they vibrate a human body
which in turn heats the human body and
can even cause temporary paralysis.
The sounds can travel hundreds
to possibly thousands of miles.
In fact, some researchers believe that
individuals can communicate with other
sperm whales on the other side of the planet.
