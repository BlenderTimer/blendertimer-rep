Did you know that you're actually
very strong? Humans have an average
bite force of over 100 kilograms
or about the weight of a refrigerator!
In their rear most teeth of course.
But a human's incisor (or front)
teeth still have a bite force
of over 40 kilograms or about
the weight of 20 bricks! No wonder
it hurts so much when I bite my
tongue...ow!
