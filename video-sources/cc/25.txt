Most people, when referring to
Earth's moon, simply call it "the moon".
But what is its actual name? Well,
according to the IAU, who sets
the definitions for all things
space, the name of Earth's moon
is..."the Moon" with a capital "M"
as a proper noun and may or may
not be preceded by a "the". The
same goes for "the Earth" and "the
Solar System". Uncreative as it
may sound, the IAU decided that:
"Calling our Moon the Moon and
our Solar System the Solar System
reinforces their importance to
humanity — they are not just any
moon or solar system."
So I guess it's fine that...
