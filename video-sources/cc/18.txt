This is the Earth. And this, is
the Moon. But, despite popular
belief, they're not anywhere near
this close to each other. The
moon is actually all the way over here.
To put this distance into perspective,
this is light traveling around
the Earth. And this is light traveling
between the Earth and the Moon.
And these, are all the planets
in the Solar System, including
all the dwarf planets. That's
right, there's still room left!
