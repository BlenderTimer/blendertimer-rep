1 thousand has 0 sets of 3 zeros
succeeding the thousand...obviously.
1 million has 1 set of 3 zeros
succeeding the thousand. And continuing
up the list we have billion, trillion,
quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion,
septillion, octillion, nonillion,
decillion, undecillion, duodecillion,
tredecillion, quattuordecillion,
quindecillion, sexdecillion,
septendecillion, octodecillion,
novemdecillion, vigintillion,
unvigintillion, duovigintillion,
trevigintillion, quattuorvigintillion,
quinvigintillion, sexvigintillion,
septenvigintillion, octovigintillion,
novemvigintillion, trigintillion,
untrigintillion, duotrigintillion,
googol, and finally googolplex.
This isn't even a googolplex,
it's just a white rectangle because
a googolplex literally exceeds
the number of atoms in the
Observable Universe.
