Your heart beats at about 80 beats per minute
but a hummingbird's heart can beat at up to
1260 beats per minute.
That's 21 beats per second!
On the flip side,
a blue whale's heart beats at about
6 beats per minute.
And their hearts weigh nearly a ton.
And, fun fact,
jellyfish don't even have hearts!
