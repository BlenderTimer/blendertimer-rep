					<p>Around 1200 AD, Hindu numerals were</p>
					<p>introduced into Europe.</p>
					<p>At which point they began to be</p>
					<p>referred to as Arabic numerals</p>
					<p>and began increasing in popularity.</p>
					<p>Through the years, Arabic numerals</p>
					<p>have spread across the entire globe</p>
					<p>and, since the 15th century,</p>
					<p>have become the most commonly</p>
					<p>used numeral system in the world.</p>
					<p>However, previous to it’s introduction</p>
					<p>in Europe, the Arabic numeral system</p>
					<p>could only be found in a few locations</p>
					<p>and was referred to as the</p>
					<p>Hindu numeral system.</p>
					<p>At that time there were wasn’t a very</p>
					<p>universal numeral system but in Europe</p>
					<p>the most commonly used numeral system</p>
					<p>was the Roman numeral system.</p>
					<p>Which, as the name suggests</p>
					<p>was invented in Rome.</p>
					<p>They were created around the time</p>
					<p>Queen Esther was born. About 500 B.C.</p>
					<p>The modern Roman numeral system</p>
					<p>we use today is composed primarily</p>
					<p>of 7 letters.</p>
					<p>I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.</p>
					<p>I is equal to 1, </p>
					<p>V is equal to 5,</p>
					<p>X is equal to 10,</p>
					<p>L is equal to 50,</p>
					<p>C is equal to 100,</p>
					<p>D is equal to 500,</p>
					<p>and M is equal to 1000.</p>
					<p>If you’re like me and have trouble</p>
					<p>remembering what each of the</p>
					<p>numerals represents,</p>
					<p>just remember that I looks</p>
					<p>like a 1,</p>
					<p>V is five which is evenly divisible</p>
					<p>(wait no it’s not),</p>
					<p>X kinda like two V’s put together(ish),</p>
					<p>L is for “Lost in Roman numerals 50 times”,</p>
					<p>C is for century (which is 100 years),</p>
					<p>D is for “Didn’t remember 500 was a D”,</p>
					<p>and M is for millennium (which is 1000 years).</p>
					<p>If you still can’t remember them</p>
					<p>than maybe this will make it a little worse.</p>
					<p>If you need to write a number that’s not</p>
					<p>one of the primary letters,</p>
					<p>like for example 149,</p>
					<p>you add larger numbers onto the end</p>
					<p>and subtract smaller numbers</p>
					<p>from the beginning.</p>
					<p>So 149 in Roman numerals</p>
					<p>would be CXLIX.</p>
					<p>Which reads out as</p>
					<p>100+(50-10)+(10-1).</p>
					<p>X is a smaller number than L</p>
					<p>so it subtracts 10 from 50 leaving 40.</p>
					<p>I is smaller than X so it</p>
					<p>subtracts 1 from 10 leaving 9.</p>
					<p>Both combined equals 49 and</p>
					<p>adding the C gives us 149.</p>
					<p>There is a major problem</p>
					<p>with this system though.</p>
					<p>Actually,</p>
					<p>there’s far more than one.</p>
					<p>First,</p>
					<p>there’s not actually one way to</p>
					<p>write numbers.</p>
					<p>999 for example can be written as</p>
					<p>CMXCIX,</p>
					<p>LMVLIV,</p>
					<p>VMIV,</p>
					<p>or simply IM.</p>
					<p>All of which equal 999 but are</p>
					<p>completely different.</p>
					<p>There are also some other ancient</p>
					<p>examples which are even more odd.</p>
					<p>Like 1613 being written as XVIXIII</p>
					<p>which literally means 16, 13</p>
					<p>but it really makes no sense</p>
					<p>unlike the standard form which is MDCXIII.</p>
					<p>Another issue is that Roman numerals</p>
					<p>take up a lot of space.</p>
					<p>While 1000 is just a simple M,</p>
					<p>as soon as you go down one digit</p>
					<p>to 999</p>
					<p>you suddenly have CMXCIX</p>
					<p>which is far longer than M.</p>
					<p>And while 1000 is M,</p>
					<p>3888 is</p>
					<p>MMMDCCCLXXXVIII.</p>
					<p>In Arabic numerals those two</p>
					<p>numbers are the exact same length,</p>
					<p>but in Roman numerals one is</p>
					<p>15 times longer than the other.</p>
					<p>Sometimes you can avoid this,</p>
					<p>like with 3999 for example.</p>
					<p>You could either write MMMCMXCIX</p>
					<p>which is the standard way,</p>
					<p>or you could write MMMIM</p>
					<p>which is not standard but is</p>
					<p>totally legal and much shorter.</p>
					<p>Yet another issue with</p>
					<p>Roman numerals</p>
					<p>is that there is no zero.</p>
					<p>Instead,</p>
					<p>if you needed a zero,</p>
					<p>you had to use the Latin word nulla.</p>
					<p>Eventually, someone decided</p>
					<p>Roman numerals needed a</p>
					<p>numeral for zero and decided</p>
					<p>to use N in the place of zero.</p>
					<p>This was to represent the “n” at</p>
					<p>the beginning of nulla.</p>
					<p>However, the N was never really</p>
					<p>standardized into Roman numerals</p>
					<p>possibly because N was also</p>
					<p>occasionally used to represent 90.</p>
					<p>Despite all these issues however,</p>
					<p>there are features in Roman numerals</p>
					<p>that you probably didn’t know.</p>
					<p>For example,</p>
					<p>fractions.</p>
					<p>If you wanted to write ½ in Roman numerals,</p>
					<p>you’d simply have to write an S.</p>
					<p>Although, S technically isn’t ½</p>
					<p>but is instead 6/12.</p>
					<p>This is because when keeping</p>
					<p>the same base number</p>
					<p>it’s much easier to handle fractions,</p>
					<p>such as ? and ¼,</p>
					<p>with 12 instead of 10.</p>
					<p>While one third of 12 is simply 4,</p>
					<p>one third of 10 is 3 point…</p>
					<p>yeah never mind.</p>
					<p>While S is the base fraction,</p>
					<p>fractions below ½ or 6/12 were still used.</p>
					<p>Any common fractions below ½ were dots.</p>
					<p>So 1/12 was one dot,</p>
					<p>2/12 was two dots,</p>
					<p>3/12 was 3 dots,</p>
					<p>4/12 was 4 dots, and</p>
					<p>5/12 was 5 dots.</p>
					<p>Then beyond was of course 6/12 as S,</p>
					<p>7/12 as S dot,</p>
					<p>8/12 as S two dots,</p>
					<p>9/12 as S three dots,</p>
					<p>10/12 as S four dots,</p>
					<p>11/12 as S five dots,</p>
					<p>and 12/12 as I,</p>
					<p>because of course 12/12 is just 1.</p>
					<p>These fractions can also be</p>
					<p>combined with other numbers.</p>
					<p>So for example,</p>
					<p>4½ would be written as IVS.</p>
					<p>There are also some other</p>
					<p>extensions to Roman numerals.</p>
					<p>The most popular being vinculum.</p>
					<p>Vinculum allows for much larger</p>
					<p>numbers than standard Roman numerals.</p>
					<p>For example the only way to write</p>
					<p>10 thousand in standard Roman numerals</p>
					<p>would be MMMMMMMMMM.</p>
					<p>But this is obviously not very ideal as</p>
					<p>it’s very long and quite confusing.</p>
					<p>Using vinculum however,</p>
					<p>you can write 10 thousand as</p>
					<p>X with a horizontal line over it</p>
					<p>which multiplies X by 1000.</p>
					<p>Or you could write it as M between</p>
					<p>two vertical lines which multiplies M by 10.</p>
					<p>Both are equal to 10 thousand</p>
					<p>and both have been used.</p>
					<p>Vinculum is the most commonly</p>
					<p>used extension today</p>
					<p>but there is one more that</p>
					<p>was previously very popular.</p>
					<p>Apostrophus was also used quite often.</p>
					<p>If you were to write 10 thousand</p>
					<p>using apostrophus,</p>
					<p>you’d simply have to write</p>
					<p>two sets of two C’s,</p>
					<p>one being mirrored,</p>
					<p>with an I in between them.</p>
					<p>Each additional set of C’s</p>
					<p>raises the value by a factor of 10.</p>
					<p>Though no one ever really wrote</p>
					<p>anything above 100,000.</p>
					<p>It was also possible to write numbers</p>
					<p>such as 5000 by using</p>
					<p>I and two backwards C’s.</p>
					<p>500 was just one backwards C,</p>
					<p>which is most likely where we get</p>
					<p>the modern D in standard Roman numerals.</p>
					<p>There were also some variations</p>
					<p>of this which linked the</p>
					<p>C’s and I together like this.</p>
					<p>Although Arabic numerals have</p>
					<p>become the worldwide standard,</p>
					<p>Roman numerals are still used quite often,</p>
					<p>like as a more interesting way of displaying</p>
					<p>a number such as the current year,</p>
					<p>or as an additional</p>
					<p>numbered indention in a list.</p>
					<p>But for everyday use</p>
					<p>and mathematics,</p>
					<p>Arabic numerals are far superior.</p>
